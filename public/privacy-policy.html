    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Mathage does not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or contact details.
      However, the App uses your browser’s local technologies for functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local Storage & Cookies</strong>: We use localStorage to save game progress and scores, and cookies to remember your sound preference.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Interaction Data</strong>: The App processes your handwriting input directly in the browser using a local machine learning model. No handwriting data, drawings, or answers are transmitted to external servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
    <p>Stored data is used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide daily challenges and track completion history.</li>
      <li>Display your past scores on the calendar and graph views.</li>
      <li>Remember your mute/unmute sound preference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All information remains on your device and is not shared with us or third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data. All gameplay data, scores, and handwriting inputs remain on your device.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses <strong>TensorFlow.js</strong>, a local machine learning library, to process handwriting recognition.
      This processing occurs entirely in your browser. No external analytics, advertising networks, or tracking services are used.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention & Control</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: Game history is stored until you clear your browser’s local storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: The mute/unmute preference cookie expires after one year.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can clear both at any time in your browser settings.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>Since data never leaves your device, there is no risk of transmission interception. Your privacy depends on the security of your browser and device.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Mathage is designed as an educational game. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
      Since no personal data is transmitted or stored on our servers, the App is safe for use by minors under parental supervision.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at <code>/privacy-policy.html</code>.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach us at: <a href="mailto:[your-email]">[your-email]</a>.</p>
